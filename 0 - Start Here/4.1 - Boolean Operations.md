# Boolean Operations

As a refresher, boolean values are values that are true or false. **Boolean logic**, and the operations that result in booleans, are all used to change how a program operates. The next chapter will cover logic and control flow in-depth.

## Boolean Expressions

**Boolean expressions** are expressions that evaluate to a boolean value. Boolean values are used to determine the logic, the truth or falsehood, of a value.

### Equals

The equality operator `==` is a boolean expression that checks if values are equal to each other. If the values are equal, it evaluates to true. Otherwise, it evaluates to false. Note that equality is always a double equals sign. If it were replaced with

```
int Number_1 = 19
int Number_2 = 21
boolean Is_Allowed_In = Number_1 == Number_2
```

`Is_Allowed_In` evaluates the expression and holds a value of false. It's a sad day that 19 does not equal 21.

### Not Equals

The not-equals operator `!=` is the complement of the equality operator. The `!` means "not," something that will be seen in chapter 4.1. For comparisons, it just means that it returns false if the values are equal, and true if the values are not equal.

### Inequalities
**Inequalities** are boolean expressions determine if a number's value is greater than or less than some value. There are four inequalities:

- `>` Greater than - Evaluates to true if the value on the left is larger than the value on the right.
- `<` Less than - Evaluates to true if the value on the left is lower than the value on the right.
- `>=` Greater than or equal to - Evaluates to true if the value on the left is greater than or equivalent to the value on the right.
- `<=` Less than or equal to - Evaluates to true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

In any case, inequalities can always be rewritten. If we have the expression `5 > 3`, it evaluates to true. We can keep this inequality true by swapping the left-hand and right-hand sides, and flipping the operator. Thus, we end up with `3 < 5`, which is still true.

## Logical Operators

The rest of this section is a compendium of the 4 logical operators: NOT, AND, OR, and XOR. Each of these operators can be combined with boolean expressions to determine

## NOT

<table class="tt">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">NOT Truth Table</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="1">Input</td>
        <td colspan="1">Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tt-break">
        <td colspan="1">A</td>
        <td colspan="1">(NOT A)</td>
    <tr>
    <!--Entries-->
        <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

</div>

NOT is a logical operator that reverses the given boolean. If the boolean is false, the output will be true, and vice versa. The pseudocode utilizes the exclamation mark `!` to show the NOT operator:

```
boolean My_Bool = false
boolean Not_My_Bool = !My_Bool
```

Not_My_Bool will now contain a value of `true`.


<div class="tt-container">

## AND

<table class="tt">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">Truth Table</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Inputs</td>
        <td colspan="1">Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tt-break">
        <td colspan="1">A</td>
        <td colspan="1">B</td>
        <td colspan="1">(A AND B)</td>
    <tr>
    <!--Entries-->
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

AND is a logical operator that only outputs true if _both_ provided inputs are true. We will use the double ampersand `&&` to represent AND.

AND is used to check if multiple conditions are true at the same time. Let's imagine that we are preventing entry to a VIP lounge. For now, only people whose name is on the list _and_ those with a VIP card are allowed to enter:

```
boolean On_VIP_List = true
boolean Has_VIP_Card = true
boolean Is_Allowed_In = On_VIP_List && Has_VIP_Card
```

`Is_Allowed_In` will only evaluate to true if both conditions are met.

## OR

<table class="tt">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">Truth Table</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Inputs</td>
        <td colspan="1">Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tt-break">
        <td colspan="1">A</td>
        <td colspan="1">B</td>
        <td colspan="1">(A OR B)</td>
    <tr>
    <!--Entries-->
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The OR operator outputs true if at least output is true. The operator is denoted by the double pipe (`||`). Let's relax our restrictions in the VIP lounge. People should be allowed in if their name is on the list, _or_ they have a VIP card.

```
boolean On_VIP_List = true
boolean Has_VIP_Card = false
boolean Is_Allowed_In = On_VIP_List || Has_VIP_Card
```

Now, this mystery person was allowed entry, despite not having a card. Right this way, ma'am!

## XOR

<table class="tt">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">Truth Table</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Inputs</td>
        <td colspan="1">Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tt-break">
        <td colspan="1">A</td>
        <td colspan="1">B</td>
        <td colspan="1">(A XOR B)</td>
    <tr>
    <!--Entries-->
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-t" colspan="1"></td>
        <td class="tt-f" colspan="1"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

XOR (exclusive or) is a special kind of OR that is represented with the single caret (`^`). Unlike regular OR, it evaluates to false when both inputs are true. This is used to check if a value is true, but not necessarily both.

For our example, let's continue with the theme of a VIP list and card system. However, if someone has both a card _and_ a list, then it's likely that 

```
boolean On_VIP_List = true
boolean Has_VIP_Card = true
boolean Is_Allowed_In = On_VIP_List ^ Has_VIP_Card
```

Sorry sir, you seem very suspicious. You are hereby banned from our VIP lounge.

### A Confession

Believe it or not, I lied to you. You may have noticed that both AND and OR used double operators (`&&` and `||`), while XOR used a single operator (`^`). Double operators have a behavior called "short circuiting."

**Short circuiting** is when a logical expression does not fully evaluate due to the final value already being determinate. For AND, if the left-hand expression already evaluated to false, then the entire expression will _never_ evaluate to true. For OR, if the left-hand expression is true, then it is impossible to ever resolve to a value of false.

The double operators are the preferred operator for most developers. Boolean expressions are very fast to evaluate, but any bit of performance helps. There's nothing stopping you from utilizing the single AND or OR operators (`&` or `|`), but always think "why would I?" Chapter 8 will introduce a new operator, where the usecase of short circuiting becomes very clear.

> **Challenge Question**: Why is there no short-circuit XOR (`^^`)?

    <summary>Answer</summary>
    Short circuiting only applies when the expression can be determined from a single value. With XOR, you cannot ever tell what the result will be based on the left-hand side.
