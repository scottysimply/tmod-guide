This guide is a programming guide to help new tMod developers learn programming concepts. I am writing this guide because many new modders _want_ to learn how to make mods, but many guides seem to expect some understanding of what code and logic are. This guide is for the absolute beginner developers.

This guide is split into three units: Unit 0 covers computers, programming, and logic. Unit 1 will begin to use C#, a programming language, to make basic programs and items. Unit 2 will cover the advanced tMod content.

All of the units are written for beginners to any computing in mind, at about a 6th grade (American) reading level. If you can read a newspaper, you can probably understand this guide.

I think it is great that new modders want to get into programming, however it is a necessity that developers take the time to learn how to code. If you are ready for the challenge, move to `1 - Computers.md`.
