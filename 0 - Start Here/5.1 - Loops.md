# Loops

Loops are a type of control flow structure that moves control back to the beginning of the statement. Loops are used to run the same code multiple times in sequence. Loops are also used as the standard way of interacting with collections, because they allow every element to be accessed exactly once.

When looping, we refer to each loop as an **iteration**. If there is a variable used to track the current iteration of a loop, we refer to it as the **iterator**. 

## While

```
while (expression)
{
    # Repeats continuously if the expression is true
}
```

Recall that an `if` statement moves control inside of its scope if a given boolean expression evaluates to true. A `while` loop is used to repeatedly run code within its scope while the condition is true. Let's view a basic example that counts up to 10:

```
int Count = 0
while (Count < 10)
{
    Count = Count + 1
}
```

When the program starts, `Count` is less than 10. Control shifts to being inside the loop, and `Count` increases by 1. The code inside of the loop will repeat until `Count` is less than 10. Note that the loop runs exactly 10 times. When the basic structure of a loop looks like the example above, it will run as many times as the number in the condition.

> **Challenge Question**: How many times will the loop run if the condition was `Count <= 10` instead?

The next example will count down, instead. Let's also run some more code in the loop:

```
int Times_To_Go = 10
int Current_Fibonacci = 1
int Second_Fibonacci = 0

while (Times_To_Go > 0)
{
    Times_To_Go = Times_To_Go - 1
    int Prev_Num = Current_Fibonacci
    Current_Fibonacci = Current_Fibonacci + Second_Fibonacci
    Second_Fibonacci = Prev_Num
}
```

This loop calculates the fibonacci numbers. The fibonacci numbers are the result of taking two numbers (starting at 0 and 1), and adding them together. The next number always utilizes the previous two numbers for the calculations. Throughout this loop, Current_Fibonacci will receive the following values: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`.

There's two different conventions (common practices) when comparing two numbers, and it depends on the circumstance. The first is that the variable should always go on the left when comparing a variable to a number. The second convention is that the inequality should prioritize a less than `<` symbol when comparing in a range, or when comparing two variables. Here's an example of when to use each:
- `My_Num < 20` and `My_Num > 10` strives to put `My_Num` on the left, both times. If we were instead checking both of these at once (with an AND `&&` operator), then it would go: `10 < My_Num && My_Num < 20`.
- `My_Num > My_Num2` would be frowned upon, since both operands are variables. Instead, it should read `My_Num2 < My_Num`.
    - There may be an instance where it makes more sense to use the former. This is just a general guideline, not a rule.

### Incrementation

Incrementation is a common necessity when utilizing loops. You may have noticed that it is wordy to write `Variable = Variable + 1` every time a variable should increase by 1. While this _does_ increase a variable's count by 1, there are two shorthands for this:

1. **Compound Assignemnt** will assign a variable to the result of the provided operator. The left-hand side of the operator is the variable on the left side of the assignment, and the right-hand side of the operator is the result of the right. For arithmetic, the operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` are used as compound assignment.
    - `My_Var += 3` compound adds 3 to `My_Var`.
    - `My_Var *= 16` multiplies `My_Var` by 16.
    - Strings can also perform compound concatenation. `My_String += ". "` appends a period and a space to the end of `My_String`.
2. **Increment and decrement** operators `++` and `--` are used to add and subtract 1, respectively. Since it is a shorthand for `+= 1`, you simply write the variables name and add the operator.
    - `My_Var++` increments `My_Var` by one.
    - `My_Var--` decrements it by one.

### Do-while

```
do
{

}
while (expression)
```

Like the while loop, a do-while loop checks for a condition to determine whether to continue running the loop. Unlike a standard while loop, do-while loops check for the condition at the _end_ of the loop. The distinction means that a do-while loop will _always_ run at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

```
int Times_Ran = 0

do
{
    Times_Ran = Times_Ran + 1
}
while (false) # while false is used to stop the loop from executing

# Times_Ran == 1
```

Do-while loops are great for repeating code _until_ a condition is true. These will be used in the next chapter for input validation.

## Foreach

```
foreach (type Variable in Collection)
{

}
```

**Foreach** loops are a type of loop that iterates on each element in a collection. They automatically know how many elements are in a collection, and will create a local variable to represent the current value in a loop. Let's use one to find the sum of all of the elements in an array:

```
array My_Numbers = [13, 8, 12, 21]
integer Sum = 0
foreach (integer Num in My_Numbers)
{
    Sum += Num
}
```

On each iteration of the loop, `Num` will be created and assigned a value _for each_ item in the array. Behind the scenes, a foreach loop is converted into a standard while loop:

```
array My_Numbers = [13, 8, 12, 21]
# Length is automatically retrieved from the current size of the array:
integer Length = 4
integer Counter = 0
while (Counter < Length)
{
    integer Num = My_Number[Counter]
    Counter++
}
```

Of course, the `Counter` variable is abstracted away in a foreach loop. When the intricacies of C# are covered in Unit 1, a new loop type will be introduced. This loop will act as an intermediary between a while loop and a foreach loop.
